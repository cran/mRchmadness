#' Test a bracket
#'
#' @param bracket.empty a length-64 character vector giving the field of 64
#'   teams in the tournament, in order of initial overall seeding
#' @param bracket.picks an length-63 character vector encoding your picks
#'   (this is the bracket to be evaluated)
#' @param prob.matrix a matrix of probabilities, with rows and columns
#'   corresponding to teams, matching the output of bradley.terry().
#'   This probabilities are used to simulate outcomes on
#'   which to evaluate bracket.picks. If NULL, prob.source is used.
#' @param prob.source source from which to use round probabilities to simulate
#'   outcomes --- "pop": ESPN's population of picks (default),
#'   "Pom": Ken Pomeroy's predictions (kenpom.com), or
#'   "538": predictions form fivethirtyeight.com.
#'   Ignored if prob.matrix is specified.
#' @param pool.source source from which to use round probabilities to simulate
#'   entries of opponents in pool. Same options as prob.source.
#' @param league which league: "men" (default) or "women", for pool.source.
#' @param year year of tournament, used for prob.source.
#'   Ignored if prob.matrix is specified.
#' @param pool.size number of brackets in your pool (excluding yours), matters
#'   only if criterion == "win" (default is 30)
#' @param num.sims number of simulations over which to evaluate the candidate
#'   brackets (default is 1000)
#' @param bonus.round a length-6 vector giving the number of points awarded in
#'   your pool's scoring rules for correct picks in each round (default is
#'   2^round)
#' @param bonus.seed a length-16 vector giving the bonus awarded for correctly
#'   picking winner based on winner's seed (default is zero)
#' @param bonus.combine how to combine the round bonus with the seed bonus to
#'   get the number of points awarded for each correct pick: "add" (default) or
#'   multiply
